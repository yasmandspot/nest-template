## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn run test

# e2e tests
$ yarn run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ yarn install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Performance Testing with k6

### Prerequisites

1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. API running locally (or in your target environment)

### Project Setup

1. Create required directories:

```bash
mkdir -p grafana/dashboards grafana/provisioning/dashboards grafana/provisioning/datasources k6-reports
```

### Running the Tests

1. First, start the NestJS API:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

2. Start the monitoring stack (in order):

```bash
# Stop any existing containers
docker-compose down

# Start services
docker-compose up -d influxdb
sleep 5  # Wait for InfluxDB to initialize

docker-compose up -d grafana
sleep 5  # Wait for Grafana to initialize
```

3. Run the k6 test:

```bash
docker-compose run k6 run /scripts/basic.js
```

### Viewing Test Results

You can view the results in two ways:

1. **HTML Report**

   - After the test completes, find the report in:
     ```
     ./k6-reports/summary.html
     ```
   - Open this file in your browser
   - The report shows:
     - Maximum number of virtual users
     - Total requests made
     - 95th percentile of request duration
     - Failed request rate

2. **Grafana Dashboard**
   - URL: http://localhost:3001
   - Login credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin`
   - After login, you'll see the "k6 Performance Results" dashboard
   - The dashboard shows real-time metrics during test execution

### Test Configuration

The test in `k6/basic.js` simulates:

- Gradual increase to 20 virtual users over 30 seconds
- Sustained load of 20 users for 1 minute
- Gradual decrease to 0 users over 30 seconds

Performance thresholds:

- 95% of requests must complete under 500ms
- Error rate must stay below 1%

### Environment Variables

You can override the API URL using:

```bash
docker-compose run -e BASE_URL=http://your-api-url k6 run /scripts/basic.js
```

### Troubleshooting

1. If Grafana dashboard is not showing:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. If k6 can't connect to your API:
   - Ensure the API is running (`yarn start:dev`)
   - Check if the API is accessible at http://localhost:3000/health
